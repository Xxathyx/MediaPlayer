### How to use MediaPlayer API

First of all, you need to add MediaPlayer.jar plugin as a library in your Java project, and add it as a plugin
into you server plugin folder.

### Brows into plugin informations with MediaPlayerAPI class :

First step : ```import fr.xxathyx.mediaplayer.api.MediaPlayerAPI;```

Then call ```getPlugin``` method in order to gain access to live running plugin informations.

### A player interacts with a screen, use the PlayerInteractScreenEvent to detect it :

You will need to : ```import fr.xxathyx.mediaplayer.api.listeners.PlayerInteractScreenEvent```

Then you can access informations such as the screen that as been touched with ```getScreen```,
the player itself : ```getPlayer``` and the click location with ```getCursorX```, ```getCursorY```.

Notice that those integers represent the real location of the click according to the size of the content displayed insed it.


### How to have audio :

In order to have audio, users must simply set their 'Server Resource Pack' to ```Prompt``` or ```Enabled```.
### When everyone is ready you can type ```vid start``` to run the video, to force starting without waiting for everyone to be ready you can type ```vid start``` anyways.
